## ðŸ§ª Focused Test Cases for SUMMARIZE

### **Test 1: News Article Summary**
**Input**: 
```
The global semiconductor shortage that began in 2020 continues to impact multiple industries in 2024. Automotive manufacturers have been hit hardest, with production delays affecting major brands like Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen. The shortage stems from increased demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, combined with supply chain disruptions in Asia. Taiwan and South Korea, which produce 75% of the world's semiconductors, experienced factory shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions. Industry experts predict the shortage will persist until late 2025, with recovery dependent on new manufacturing facilities currently under construction in the United States and Europe. Companies are now diversifying their supply chains and investing in domestic production to reduce future vulnerabilities.
```

**Expected Output**:
- Lead with main impact (semiconductor shortage affecting industries)
- Include key facts (75%, 2025, etc.)
- Mention specific companies and solutions

### **Test 2: Technical Process Summary**
**Input**:
```
Machine learning model training involves several critical steps that determine the final model's performance. First, data collection and preprocessing clean and prepare raw data for analysis, including handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets. Next, feature engineering selects and transforms the most relevant variables that will help the model make accurate predictions. The model selection phase involves choosing appropriate algorithms based on the problem type - classification, regression, or clustering. During training, the algorithm learns patterns from the training data by adjusting internal parameters through iterative optimization processes. Validation testing evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on unseen data. Finally, hyperparameter tuning fine-tunes model settings to optimize performance, followed by deployment to production environments where the model makes real-world predictions.
```

### **Test 3: Meeting Notes Summary**
**Input**:
```
Today's quarterly review meeting covered our Q3 performance and Q4 planning. Revenue reached $2.4 million, exceeding our $2.2 million target by 9%. The marketing team reported a 35% increase in lead generation, with social media campaigns performing particularly well. However, customer acquisition costs rose 15% due to increased competition. The product team announced three new features launching in November: advanced analytics dashboard, mobile app integration, and automated reporting. Development is on schedule, but QA testing may need an additional week. HR discussed hiring plans for Q4, including two senior developers, one UX designer, and a customer success manager. Budget approval is pending for the new hires. Action items include: Sarah to finalize Q4 marketing budget by Friday, Mike to coordinate with QA on testing timeline, and Jennifer to prepare job descriptions for new positions.
```

- Concise but complete

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Starts with main achievement (revenue target exceeded)
- [ ] Groups information logically
- [ ] Preserves all numbers and percentages
- [ ] Lists clear action items
- [ ] Maintains business context

### **Test 4: Research Paper Abstract Summary**
**Input**:
```
This study investigates the effectiveness of remote work on employee productivity and job satisfaction across 500 companies in the technology sector. Data was collected through surveys, performance metrics, and interviews conducted between January 2023 and December 2023. Results indicate that remote work increased productivity by an average of 22% compared to traditional office settings. Employee satisfaction scores improved by 31%, with work-life balance being the most cited benefit. However, collaboration challenges emerged, with 68% of teams reporting communication difficulties. Companies that implemented structured virtual meeting protocols and invested in collaboration tools showed 40% better team performance than those without such measures. The study concludes that remote work can be highly effective when supported by proper infrastructure and management practices. Recommendations include establishing clear communication guidelines, investing in technology platforms, and maintaining regular team check-ins to maximize the benefits of remote work arrangements.
