## üìä Before vs After Examples

### **Before (Too Complex)**:
Input: `write a story`
Bad Output: 
```
You are a professional creative writer with expertise in narrative structure, character development, and literary techniques. Create a compelling narrative that demonstrates mastery of storytelling elements including but not limited to: character arc development, three-act structure, dialogue authenticity, setting establishment, conflict resolution, thematic depth, and stylistic consistency. The story should incorporate advanced literary devices such as foreshadowing, symbolism, and metaphorical language while maintaining reader engagement through pacing and tension management. Consider the target audience demographics, genre conventions, and contemporary literary trends when crafting your response. Ensure the narrative includes proper exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution while developing multi-dimensional characters with clear motivations and realistic dialogue patterns...
```

### **After (Reasonable)**:
Input: `write a story`
Good Output:
```
Write a creative short story (500-800 words) with:
- A clear beginning, middle, and end
- Interesting characters and dialogue
- A specific setting and conflict
- Engaging narrative style
```
